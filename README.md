## Current Status <br>
<ul>
<li>Vrixe was pulled from deployment on March 26 due to the reduction in usage that seems to be from the Corona virus outbreak and I have decided to take this time to polish the code and think about proper deployment on a scaleable server and environment.</li><br>

<li>I have also decided to make the code available for contribution so feel free to reach out if youre interested.</li>


<li>Currently working on something new that might be more remote friendly, check out the repo here https://github.com/chrisenitan/dotta</li>
